It is inferred that the X-rays are the bremsstrahlung radiation emitted from energetic electrons which have been accelerated through run-away processes. It is suggested and supported that the structures responsible for the acceleration are strong double-layers which are supported by the very high current densities attributed to lightning discharges.},

The balloon passed through a region of high electric field strength, at which time an increase in X ray intensity of about 2 orders of magnitude occurred, lasting for approximately 1 min. The X ray intensity returned to background levels at the time of a lightning flash that reduced the electric field strength measured at the balloon. This observation suggests that the production mechanism for the X rays we observed is related to the storm electric field and not necessarily to lightning discharge processes.},

Dose increases measured by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) exposed during a period including a lightning flash were up to about 0.1 mGy. Dose rates indicated by environmental radiation monitors around the facility also increased transiently at that time. From pulse-height analysis of an NaI(Tl) scintillation detector, the photon energy spectrum evaluated by spectral unfolding is continuous with energy up to several MeV, consistent with bremsstrahlung emission from energetic electrons. Furthermore, energy spectra of bremsstrahlung photons emitted from high-energy electrons are obtained by Monte Carlo calculation. These results are discussed in conjunction with observation.},

	Abstract = {Lightning and thunderclouds are natural particle accelerators. Avalanches of relativistic runaway electrons, which develop in electric fields within thunderclouds, emit bremsstrahlung γ-rays. These γ-rays have been detected by ground-based observatories, by airborne detectors and as terrestrial γ-ray flashes from space. The energy of the γ-rays is sufficiently high that they can trigger atmospheric photonuclear reactions that produce neutrons and eventually positrons via β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay of the unstable radioactive isotopes, most notably &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N, which is generated via &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + γ → &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N + n, where γ denotes a photon and n a neutron. However, this reaction has hitherto not been observed conclusively, despite increasing observational evidence of neutrons and positrons that are presumably derived from such reactions. Here we report ground-based observations of neutron and positron signals after lightning. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a γ-ray flash with a duration of less than one millisecond was detected at our monitoring sites 0.5-1.7 kilometres away from the lightning. The subsequent γ-ray afterglow subsided quickly, with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 milliseconds, and was followed by prolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolts, which lasted for a minute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 megaelectronvolts of the γ-ray afterglow are well explained by de-excitation γ-rays from nuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line emission corresponds to electron-positron annihilation, providing conclusive evidence of positrons being produced after the lightning.},

abstract = {Abstract An on-ground observation program for high-energy atmospheric phenomena in winter thunderstorms along the Japan Sea has been performed via measurements of gamma ray radiation, atmospheric electric field, and low-frequency radio band. On 11 February 2017, the radiation detectors recorded gamma ray emission lasting for 75 s, and then abruptly terminated with a nearby lightning discharge. The gamma ray spectrum extended up to 20 MeV and was reproduced by a cutoff power law model with a photon index of , being consistent with Bremsstrahlung radiation from a thundercloud (known as a gamma-ray glow or a thunderstorm ground enhancement). The low-frequency radio monitors, installed ∼50 km away from the gamma ray observation site recorded leader development of an intracloud/intercloud discharge spreading over ∼60 km area with a ∼300-ms duration. The timing of the gamma ray termination coincided with the moment when the leader development of the intracloud/intercloud discharge passed 0.7 km horizontally away from the radiation monitors. The intracloud/intercloud discharge started ∼15 km away from the gamma ray observation site. Therefore, the glow was terminated by the leader development, while it did not trigger the lightning discharge in the present case.},

abstract = {Abstract The analysis of high-energy background radiation (0.1–2 MeV) enhancements during eight winter thunderstorms and five summer storms in the Ebro delta region in the northeast of Spain is presented. For the first time, high-energy radiation counts, precipitation, radar reflectivity, and very high frequency lightning detections to infer charge regions altitude have been analyzed in order to find out what produces the measured background radiation increments associated with storms. The good agreement between radar reflectivity and precipitation with increases in background radiation counts coupled with the spectrum analysis comparing rain/no rain periods suggests that radon-ion daughters play a major role in the radiation increments reported. No evidence has been found supporting that measured background radiation enhancements can be produced by storm electric fields. Finally, a single case of a high-energy radiation increase was prior to a cloud-to-ground lightning stroke, which reinforces the theory that a lower positive charge layer's existence is important for the production of Terrestrial Ground Enhancements.},

abstract = {Abstract This work presents the first simultaneous X-ray measurements from natural lightning in coincidence with a very high frequency (VHF) broadband interferometer. During an observational campaign in north-central Colombia, five intense X-ray bursts were detected from negative stepped leaders and two X-ray emissions from a dart leader. Thanks to the high angular and time resolution of the interferometer, it was possible to locate the origin of high-energy radiation during the lightning leader propagation. We study the correlation with VHF pulses and the two-dimensional speed of the leader channels. A strong temporal correspondence has been observed between the high-energy emissions and the most intense VHF pulses, which suggests the runaway electrons as a shared mechanism. The observations show that an X-ray burst can have multiple high-energy sources belonging to different leader branches, that can be several hundreds of meters apart. Therefore, from a spatial point of view, not a unique origin has to be searched, but an extensive origin of the X-ray burst should be considered. We hypothesize similar conclusions in particular for downward TGFs and maybe for TGFs in general.},

abstract = {Lightning is located by using the time of group arrival (TOGA) of the VLF (3–30kHz) radiation from a lightning stroke. The dispersed waveform (“sferic”) of the lightning impulse is processed at each receiving site. The TOGA is determined relative to GPS at each site from the progression of phase versus frequency using the whole wave train. Unlike current VLF methods which require transmission of the whole wave train from each site to a central processing site, the TOGA method requires transmission of a single number (the TOGA) for lightning location calculation. The stable propagation and low attenuation of VLF waves in the Earth–ionosphere waveguide (EIWG) allows a wide spacing of receiver sites of several thousand kilometer so that a truly global location service could be provided using only ∼10 receiver sites.}

In this paper, we describe the method of event coincidence analysis to provide a framework for quantifying the strength, directionality and time lag of statistical interrelationships between event series. Event coincidence analysis allows to formulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed interrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more generally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time distribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to country-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted as triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected future changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical techniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for investigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies and ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we report the first close, high-resolution observations of downward-directed terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) detected by the large-area Telescope Array cosmic ray observatory, obtained in conjunction with broadband VHF interferometer and fast electric field change measurements of the parent discharge. The results show that the TGFs occur during strong initial breakdown pulses (IBPs) in the first few milliseconds of negative cloud-to-ground and low-altitude intracloud flashes and that the IBPs are produced by a newly identified streamer-based discharge process called fast negative breakdown. The observations indicate the relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREAs) responsible for producing the TGFs are initiated by embedded spark-like transient conducting events (TCEs) within the fast streamer system and potentially also by individual fast streamers themselves. The TCEs are inferred to be the cause of impulsive sub-pulses that are characteristic features of classic IBP sferics. Additional development of the avalanches would be facilitated by the enhanced electric field ahead of the advancing front of the fast negative breakdown. In addition to showing the nature of IBPs and their enigmatic sub-pulses, the observations also provide a possible explanation for the unsolved question of how the streamer to leader transition occurs during the initial negative breakdown, namely, as a result of strong currents flowing in the final stage of successive IBPs, extending backward through both the IBP itself and the negative streamer breakdown preceding the IBP.},

abstract = {Abstract We present the ground-based observation of a terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF) that occurred between positive (second) and negative (third) strokes of a five-stroke bipolar cloud-to-ground lightning flash. Those two strokes shared the same channel to ground at a distance of 200 m or so from the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville (LOG), Florida. Earlier TGF observations at ground level in Florida (a total of four) were either associated with the initial continuous current (ICC) of rocket-triggered lightning flashes or occurred during the relatively steady current following the return-stroke current peak in natural lightning flashes; that is, in the presence of current-carrying channel to ground. The TGF presented here occurred in a different context: at the early (in-cloud) stage of negative leader entering the remnants of the channel previously created by the positive stroke. The TGF had a duration of 35 μs and consisted of 18 pulses with amplitudes ranging from 114 to 912 keV. The overall flash context in which the TGF occurred was as follows. The first (143-kA) stroke was negative and terminated on ground 1.4 km from LOG, the second (12-kA) stroke was positive and forged a new path to ground about 200 m from LOG, and the third (28-kA) stroke (TGF producer) was negative and followed the path of the second (positive) stroke. The fourth (43-kA) stroke was negative and created a new termination on ground about 900 m from LOG, and the fifth (4.5-kA) stroke was also negative and followed the fourth-stroke channel.},

abstract = {Ground-based observations of energetic radiation (X-rays/gamma-rays) associated with natural lightning discharges are presented and discussed. The emphasis is placed on relating X-ray/gamma-ray emissions to specific lightning processes. X-rays/gamma-rays have been observed in the following three contexts: (1) final stages of the descending leader, (2) collision of opposite-polarity streamers at the onset of lightning attachments process, and (3) in-cloud processes giving rise to energetic radiation bursts characteristic of Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs). In all three cases, the X-ray/gamma-ray production involves runaway electrons and can be materially influenced (enhanced) by the presence of previously created but decayed lightning channels. Such channels are characterized by elevated temperature (about 3,000 K vs. 300 K for ambient air), which significantly lowers the friction curve (representing the spatial rate of electron energy loss), so that its peak is an order of magnitude lower than that for cold air. As a result, in the electric field of about 4 MV/m (such and even higher fields are briefly produced near the tips of lightning leaders), ambient electrons can be accelerated over the friction-curve peak to the keV range and further to relativistic energies needed for production of X-ray/gamma-ray emissions. Significant avalanching of runaway electrons seems to be possible. For one very intense (55 kA) subsequent stroke, which was a prolific X-ray/gamma-ray producer, we estimated the spatial extent of strong (>4 MV/m) electric field region associated with the descending leader tip to be about 1.5 m, which is sufficient for multiplication of runaway electrons by a factor of 2 × 104 or so.}

abstract = {Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are bright, sub-millisecond bursts of gamma-rays, originating within the Earth's atmosphere. Most TGFs have been detected by spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. Only two TGFs have previously been observed from within our atmosphere: one at ground level and one from an aircraft at 14.1 km. We report on a new TGF-like gamma-ray flash observed at ground level, detected by the 19-station Thunderstorm Energetic Radiation Array (TERA) at the University of Florida/Florida Tech International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT). The gamma-ray flash, which had a duration of 52.7 μs, occurred on June 30, 2009 during a natural negative cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke, 191 μs after the start of the stroke. This event is the first definitive association of a gamma-ray flash with natural CG lightning and is among the most direct links to a specific lightning process so far. For this event, 19 gamma-rays were recorded, with the highest energy exceeding 20 MeV. The high-energy radiation exhibited very different behavior from the typical x-ray emission from lightning. Specifically, the gamma-ray flash had a much harder energy spectrum, consistent with relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) multiplication; it did not arrive in sub-microsecond bursts, typical of leader emission from lightning, and it occurred well after the start of the return stroke, which has not been previously observed for the x-ray emission from lightning. Nevertheless, we present evidence that the source region for the gamma ray flash was the same as that for the preceding leader x-ray bursts.},

The streamers are initiated in overbreakdown field conditions, 1.5Ekand2Ek, respectively, which may be found during the corona flash stage of negative leader stepping processes. We find that while streamer propagation produces stronger VHF radiation, the head-on collision of streamers dominates UHF, and even higher-frequency radiation. Analysis of the energy spectral densities obtained from different simulation cases shows that the total length and radii of colliding streamers, as well as the ambient field, are important parameters for the UHF radiation produced by streamer collisions. The larger those parameters are, the stronger UHF radiation produced. Finally, by comparing with the measured spectral magnitude of lightning field in the VHF range, it is found that there are probably 105–107 streamers involved during the lightning corona flash stage.},

Unlike detectors based on a Si diode, which are commonly used for long-term measurements, these detectors can also be used for detection of high-energy gamma-rays generated in thunderstorms. For a correct interpretation of the measured data it is important to perform an energy calibration and to verify the detector response in known radiation fields.

abstract = {The existing interpretation in the lightning literature, based on field measurements, defines recoil leaders as negative leaders. However recoil leaders are floating conductors, and, based on this physical assumption, they should be defined as bipolar and bidirectional leaders. This physics-based assumption has never previously been verified experimentally. Such verification, reported in this paper, has been obtained from observations of branched upward positive leaders from a tall tower using a high-speed video system synchronized with electric and magnetic field change and luminosity measurements on the ground. The analysis of these observations clearly reveals the nature of recoil and dart leaders as bidirectional and bipolar electrodeless discharges that develop from a small region along a path of the decayed channels of a previous positive leader, or a positively charged return stroke of negative CG flashes.}

abstract = {Using a new radio interferometric technique, we present observations of VHF lightning radiation source positions. The crossed base line interferometer provides the directions of arrival (azimuth and elevation) of VHF lightning radiation. Much flexibility exists in the choice of instrument parameters such as operating frequency and sampling interval. The present instrument operates at 34.3 MHz and provides an average position for every 2.5 μs of lightning radiation. Observations indicate that each 2.5 μs position should be attributed to a single discrete source in the sky. The positions of such sources define the temporal and spatial development of breakdown and rapid charge acceleration during the lightning flash. We have obtained VHF source positions correlated in time with electric field measurements. This allows us to identify the various processes occurring during a discharge and to compare the VHF phenomena with previously observed lightning phenomena. We have analyzed six flashes completely and portions of others. All six flashes contained ground strokes and two had intracloud discharges following the ground flash. We present data from three flashes that showed features common to the flashes we analyzed. The initial (preceding the first return stroke) and intracloud portions consisted of a large number of bursts of 20 μs average duration occurring on the average every 100 μs. The positions within each burst developed in a systematic, nearly linear, sequence with apparent speeds of ∼107 m/s. The relative positions from burst to burst drifted through the sky with speeds ∼105 m/s. In intracloud portions this drift was predominantly horizontal. In ground flashes the VHF sources drifted downward, in effect the leader for the first return stroke. They terminated at the return stroke.},

ABSTRACT = {Very-high-frequency (VHF) electromagnetic signals have been well used to image lightning channels with high temporal and spatial resolution due to their capability to penetrate clouds. A lightning broadband VHF interferometer with three VHF antennas configured in a scalene-triangle shape has been installed in Lhasa since 2019, to detect the lightning VHF signals. Using the signals from the VHF interferometer, a new hybrid algorithm, called the TDOA-EMTR technique, combining the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and the electromagnetic time reversal (EMTR) technique is introduced to image the two-dimensional lightning channels. The TDOA technique is firstly applied to calculate the initial solutions for the whole lightning flash. According to the results by the TDOA method, the domain used for the EMTR technique is predetermined, and then the EMTR technique is operated to obtain the final positioning result. Unlike the original EMTR technique, the low-power frequency points for each time window are removed based on the FFT spectrum. Metrics used to filter noise events are adjusted. Detailed imaging results of a negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flash and an intra-cloud (IC) lightning flash by the TDOA method and the TDOA-EMTR are presented. Compared with the original EMTR method, the positioning efficiency can be improved by more than a factor of 3 to 4, depending on the scope of the pre-determined domain. Results show that the new algorithm can obtain much weaker radiation sources and simultaneously occurring sources, compared with the TDOA method.},

In this paper, several balloon flight experiments are described focusing on the study of the latitudinal effect on the position of the Regener–Pfotzer maximum. Altitude profile of ionization in the atmosphere was measured using radiation detectors flown during several flights at locations with different effective vertical cut-off rigidities (flight HEMERA over Sweden and flights FIK-5 and FIK-6 over Czech Republic). The measured results are supplemented also with simulations using EXPACS 4.11 and the variation of obtained positions of Regener–Pfotzer maximum is discussed.}",

abstract = {The impact of lightning on humans and its threats on life and structures have encouraged the scientists to pursue study in this field. Lightning flash is a high current electric discharge that can be classified into five categories which are intra-cloud discharges, cloud to cloud, cloud to air, ground to cloud and cloud to ground discharges. Intra-cloud discharges have the main portion of the lightning flashes. The most damages and disturbances of lightning flashes are due to cloud to ground and ground to cloud flashes. The discharge phenomenon has various behaviors even in the same thunderstorm. The cloud to ground lightning discharge starts with preliminary breakdown pulses followed by leaders which cause return strokes. The subsequent strokes happen after the first return stroke in a typical lightning flash, but in few flashes the discharges do not lead to any subsequent strokes. This research investigates on these types of flashes which are called isolated breakdown lightning flashes, in Malaysia. The isolated breakdown flashes have rarely been seen in tropical regions compared with temperate areas. Among 150 selected waveforms on 9th May 2013 in our measurement station, only 10 isolated lightning flashes were observed in our dataset, which make up less than 7% of total flashes in one thunderstorm.}

abstract = {Summary Ball lightning is the most mysterious phenomenon of atmospheric electricity. There are some general problems: it unexpectedly appears anywhere, it can be seen only from a short distance, its lifetime is short and it has never been artificially reproduced. Two theoretical explanations are suggested for this. The first is that an external supply continuously recovers the radiated energy, and the second is a process of energy storage as an internal supply. Russian physicist, Kapitza, studied the problem of thermonuclear processes and found that high-frequency electromagnetic field can supply a hot plasma sphere when resonance exists between them. Beaded lightning is a spectacular phenomenon of atmospheric electricity. It has been only observed as lightning discharges in the clouds but never as ground flashes. The electric field drives positive ions upwards from the top of the thunderstorm cloud to the ionosphere.}

The study is built on a FORTE database of intracloud pulsed radio signals from storms whose geolocation is provided either by coincidence with the FORTE optical imager or by coincidence with ground-based lightning-detection arrays. We show statistically that intracloud radio emissions with peak power >40 kW in the FORTE low band (26–48 MHz) have unique characteristics compared to weaker emissions, including: occurring either in isolation or at the start of leader progression but never within a progressing leader; occurring without light emission detectable by FORTE; sometimes occurring in association with a rapid (10 μs) relaxation of the electric charge; and being followed by an upward progressing leader in the cases where a leader is initiated. These strong intracloud radio pulses appear to be associated with an intracloud discharge process that is physically distinct from conventional leader progression.},

The radio-frequency (RF) data for the first 7 months of operation are described, both to illustrate the satellite's capabilities and to explain the basic statistical findings so far. FORTE's multichannel RF trigger system represents a significant advance in space-based monitoring of lightning emissions. We are able to observe even rather weak and diffuse RF emissions from lightning and are no longer limited to the brightest known events, “transionospheric pulse pairs,” or TIPPs. We do see TIPPs, and we show that the FORTE observations of TIPPs are consistent only with the second pulse's being due to a ground reflection. We find that TIPPs are basically bimodal in character, one type having a steep roll-off of power from 38 to 130 MHz and the other being essentially flat-spectrum in that range. The steep-spectrum TIPPs cluster together in the manner of most RF emissions from lightning, while the flat-spectrum events tend to maintain a wider spacing (>0.1 s) between recurrent emissions.},

abstract = {The unique maneuverability, ease of deployment, simplicity in logistics, and relatively low costs of multicopters render them effective vehicles for low atmospheric research. While many efforts have contributed to the fundamental success of atmospheric applications of multicopters in the past, several challenges remain, including limited measurable variables, possible response-delay in real-time observations, insufficient measurement accuracy, endurance of harsh conditions and tolerance towards interferences. To address these challenges and further fortify the applicability in diversified research disciplines, this study developed an optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST). The MUST serves as an integrated platform by combining self-developed algorithms, optimized working environments for sensors/monitors, and retrofitted sampling devices to probe a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. These variables of interest include meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind direction and speed), the chemical composition (speciated VOCs, CO, CO2, CH4, CO2 isotopologues, O3, PM2.5, and black carbon), and the radiation flux, as well as visible and thermal images. The aim of this study is to achieve the following objectives: 1. to easily probe a comprehensive set of near-surface atmospheric variables; 2. to improve data quality by correcting for sensors’ delay in real-time observations and minimizing environmental interferences; and 3. to enhance the versatility and applicability of aerial measurements by incorporating necessary hardware and software. Field launching cases from the surface to a maximum height of 1000 m were conducted to validate the robustness of the integrated MUST platform with sufficient speed, accuracy and resolution for the target variables.}

abstract = {Recently, wide band measurements of the electric field near a lightning flash have been obtained by a balloon-borne electric field sonde or Esonde. This paper develops new techniques for analyzing lightning-associated charge transport in a thundercloud by using both the Esonde data and simultaneous Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) measurements of VHF pulses emitted during lightning breakdown processes. Innovations in this paper include the following: (1) A filtering procedure is developed to separate the background field associated with instrument rotation and cloud charging processes from the lightning-induced electric field change. Because of the abrupt change in the signal caused by lightning, standard filtering techniques do not apply. A new mathematical procedure is developed to estimate the background electric field that would have existed if the lightning had not occurred. The estimated background field is subtracted from the measured field to obtain the lightning-induced field change. (2) Techniques are developed to estimate the charge transport due to lightning. At any instant of time during a cloud-to-ground (CG) flash, we estimate the charge transport by a monopole. During an intracloud (IC) flash, we estimate the charge transport by a dipole. Since the location of the monopole and dipole changes with time, they are referred to as a dynamic monopole and a dynamic dipole. The following physical constraints are used to achieve a unique fit: charge conservation during an IC flash, separation (distance between the CG monopole charge center and the ground and separation between IC dipole charge centers both exceed a minimum threshold), location (charge is placed on lightning channel), and likelihood (after a statistical analysis based on instrument uncertainty, highly unlikely charge locations are excluded). To implement the constraint that the charge is located on the lightning channel, we develop a mathematical object called the “pulse graph.” Vertices in the graph are pulse locations obtained from the Lightning Mapping Array. Edges in the graph (that is, the pairs of vertices which are connected by line segments) are obtained by joining, in a systematic way, neighboring vertices. One CG and two IC flashes observed on 18 August 2004 near Langmuir Laboratory are analyzed. In the CG flash, initial strokes drained 12 C charge from an altitude of 5 km, while an intermediate stroke discharged 12 C from a higher charge center at 8 km. For the IC flashes, the current flow lagged behind the channel formation by time intervals on the order of 0.1 s, roughly the same time delay observed for lightning optical signals detected by NASA's Lightning Imaging Sensor.},

  abstract = {Abstract We examine excitation of ultralow frequency (ULF) electromagnetic waves by an atmospheric lightning stroke in the upper ionosphere and the role of the ionospheric Alfvén resonator (IAR) in this process. We have theoretically calculated with the developed numerical model the spatial and spectral structures of electromagnetic disturbance in the ULF frequency range 0.1–6.0 Hz excited by an atmospheric lightning stroke on the ground and at ionospheric altitudes. The frequency band under consideration comprises typical frequencies of the IAR and the ionospheric waveguide. The spectra of horizontal magnetic and electric components reveal a spectral multiband structure in the upper ionosphere. The form of spectra depends significantly on the horizontal distance ρ from the source: spectral peaks associated with the IAR are evident at ρ≤400 km, whereas at ρ≥1,000 km the spectral peaks (>4 Hz) corresponding to the ionospheric waveguide modes can be seen. The model predicts that a vertical electric discharge with the charge moment MQ=106 C·m produces at altitude 500 km and ρ = 40 km a pulse with electric and magnetic amplitudes of about 4 mV/m and 4 nT, correspondingly, and duration ∼0.2 s. The pulse amplitude decays rather slowly with distance . Detection of ULF response in the upper ionosphere to isolated intense lightning stroke by low-orbiting satellites with magnetic or electric sensors onboard is quite feasible.},

We show that the events under thunderstorm conditions have larger circular polarization component near the core of the shower than the events under fair weather conditions.

These open-source simulation tools are readily adapted to real-time operations or detailed studies of performance. Each simulation accounted for receiver threshold and location, as well as a reference distribution of source powers and flash sizes based on thunderstorm observations and the mechanics of station triggering. Source and flash detection efficiency were combined with solution bias and variability to predict flash area distortion at long ranges. Location errors and detection efficiency were highly dependent on the station configuration and thresholds, especially at longer ranges, such that performance varied more than expected across different networks and with azimuth within networks. Error characteristics matched prior studies, which led to an increase in flash distortion with range. Predicted flash detection efficiency exceeded 95\% within 100 km of all networks.},

Results show that concurrent branches of stepped leaders can be readily resolved, and K changes and dart leaders with speeds up to 2.4 × 107 m/s are also well imaged. These results demonstrate that FALMA can reconstruct three-dimensional structures of lightning flashes with great details. Location accuracy of FALMA is estimated by comparing the located striking points of successive RSs in cloud-to-ground flashes. Results show that distances between successive RSs are mainly below 25 m, indicating exceptionally high location accuracy of FALMA.},

abstract = {Abstract We investigate a novel way to quantify Very Low Frequency transmission in the Earth-Ionosphere Waveguide, using data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The lightning signals from intense and long-duration storm clusters are recorded at several stations. Any individual stroke amplitude is in principle unknown, so that the recorded electric field from that stroke varies semi-randomly from the recorded field due to other strokes from that storm cluster. Thus, it is not possible to straightforwardly infer the channel characteristics from a stroke recorded at a single station. However, if two stations record the signal from the same stroke, then the inter-station ratio of the recorded amplitude on the two fixed propagation paths is (in the absence of noise) independent of source power. We develop a procedure to provide information on time-variations in the waveguide transmission, using an approach based on ratios of amplitudes from pair of stations which record the same strokes. These amplitude-ratio data are then compared to an existing model of full-wave Very Low Frequency reflection from the underside of the ionosphere.},

abstract="During the past years a lightning detection network (LINET) was developed at the University of Munich, which utilizes the low-frequency range (VLF/LF). It is steadily expanded and presently comprises about 90 sensors in 17 countries, covering an area from longitude 10{\textdegree} W--35{\textdegree} E to latitude 30{\textdegree} N--65{\textdegree} N. The network is serviced and continuously operated by nowcast GmbH, the official provider of lightning data for the German Weather Service, and offers real-time and historic data for many national and international scientific projects. LINET presents numerous options for users of lightning data, because it detects small signal amplitudes and, thus, is sensitive not only to weak cloud-to-ground strokes (CG) but also to cloud lightning (IC). The number of located IC discharges is large enough to attribute `total-lightning'-quality to the network, otherwise accessible only by additional implementation of VHF technologies. Discrimination of CG from IC is achieved by means of a new 3D time-of-arrival (TOA) method, applicable within the sufficiently dense parts of the network. IC emission heights are extracted for each cloud event, which are thought to reflect the central region of the involved lightning channel. Position accuracy of strokes reaches an average value as small as {\textasciitilde}150 m, provided that corrections for site-errors and propagation effects have been carried out. Important for many applications is the narrow distribution of errors around the mean, i.e. false locations (`outliers') rarely occur, enhancing the efficiency of cell-tracking and other nowcasting applications of lightning data. During international co-operations in scientific campaigns directed by DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt), a smaller version of LINET has been deployed and tested in four continents, Europe, South America, Australia, and Central Africa. In order to examine the achieved features in some detail lightning data have been compared between LINET and many national and global networks.",

abstract={Transient spatiotemporal events occur within a short interval of time, in a particular location. If such events occur unexpectedly with varying durations, frequencies, and intensities, they pose a challenge for near-real-time monitoring. Lightning strikes are examples of such events and they can have severe negative consequences, such as fires, or they precede sudden flash storms, which can result in damage to infrastructure, loss of Internet connectivity, interruption of electrical power supply, and loss of life or property. Furthermore, they are unexpected, momentary in occurrence, sometimes with high frequency and then again with long intervals between them, their intensity varies considerably, and they are difficult to trace once they have occurred. Despite their unpredictable and irregular nature, timely analysis of lightning events is crucial for understanding their patterns and behaviour so that any adverse effects can be mitigated. However, near-real-time monitoring of unexpected and irregular transient events presents technical challenges for their analysis and visualisation. This paper demonstrates an approach for overcoming some of the challenges by clustering and visualising data streams with information about lightning events during thunderstorms, in real time. The contribution is twofold. Firstly, we detect clusters in dynamic spatiotemporal lightning events based on space, time, and attributes, using graph theory, that is adaptive and does not prescribe number and size of clusters beforehand, and allows for use of multiple clustering criteria and thresholds, and formation of different cluster shapes. Secondly, we demonstrate how the space time cube can be used to visualise unexpected and irregular transient events. Along with the visualisation, we identify the interactive elements required to counter challenges related to visualising unexpected and irregular transient events through space time cubes.},

Its main advantages are that it is small and lightweight with low power consumption. It can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g. used in pressurized cabins of spacecraft or in vacuum environments in CubeSats or larger satellites. The open-source design enables better portability and reproduction of the results than other similar detectors. The detector has already successfully performed measurements on board the International Space Station. The obtained results are discussed and compared with those measured with thermoluminescent detectors located in the same position as SPACEDOS.}",

The radiation field is not constant in time and due to various effects, not routinely considered in calculations, the exposure can increase several times. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of radiation exposure on board is required. This article characterises newly developed detectors Airdos-C with diverse scintillation crystals. Unlike detectors based on a Si diode, which are commonly used for long-term measurements, these detectors can also be used for detection of high-energy gamma-rays generated in thunderstorms. For a correct interpretation of the measured data it is important to perform an energy calibration and to verify the detector response in known radiation fields. The results obtained with several radionuclide sources were analysed using mathematical statistics methods. The detectors were also exposed onboard aircraft under well-defined conditions.}",

The intensities and the composition of the radiation field change with latitude and altitude and with solar activity. At cruising altitudes between 11 and 13 km aircraft crews are exposed to doses up to 10 µSv.h-1 by galactic cosmic rays and their secondary products. This exposure came into the focus of interest, when the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommended a decrease in the annual limit from 50 mSv to 20 mSv for occupational exposures due to greatly increased excess cancer risk coefficients for low level exposures. ICRP recommends including the operation of jet aircraft as occupational exposure. Applying 600 flight hours, crews become one of the most highly exposed occupational groups. This paper presents a review of available data and indicates areas where additional research is highly recommended.}",

Balloon launchings performed several times a week at northern and southern polar latitudes as well as at midlatitudes yield a homogeneous data series for the study of the spatial distribution and temporal changes in the cosmic-ray intensity. The 11- and 22-year solar modulation, north-south asymmetry, energy hysteresis and a long-term trend in the cosmic-ray intensity are discussed. The fluxes and energy spectra of protons with energy > 100 MeV for about 100 solar energetic particle events in 1958-1992 are given. The role of cosmic rays in terrestrial atmospheric processes is briefly discussed.},
