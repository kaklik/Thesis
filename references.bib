It is inferred that the X-rays are the bremsstrahlung radiation emitted from energetic electrons which have been accelerated through run-away processes.

The balloon passed through a region of high electric field strength, at which time an increase in X ray intensity of about 2 orders of magnitude occurred, lasting for approximately 1 min. The X ray intensity returned to background levels at the time of a lightning flash that reduced the electric field strength measured at the balloon. This observation suggests that the production mechanism for the X rays we observed is related to the storm electric field and not necessarily to lightning discharge processes.},

Dose increases measured by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) exposed during a period including a lightning flash were up to about 0.1 mGy. Dose rates indicated by environmental radiation monitors around the facility also increased transiently at that time. From pulse-height analysis of an NaI(Tl) scintillation detector, the photon energy spectrum evaluated by spectral unfolding is continuous with energy up to several MeV, consistent with bremsstrahlung emission from energetic electrons. Furthermore, energy spectra of bremsstrahlung photons emitted from high-energy electrons are obtained by Monte Carlo calculation. These results are discussed in conjunction with observation.},

	Abstract = {Lightning and thunderclouds are natural particle accelerators. Avalanches of relativistic runaway electrons, which develop in electric fields within thunderclouds, emit bremsstrahlung γ-rays. These γ-rays have been detected by ground-based observatories, by airborne detectors and as terrestrial γ-ray flashes from space. The energy of the γ-rays is sufficiently high that they can trigger atmospheric photonuclear reactions that produce neutrons and eventually positrons via β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay of the unstable radioactive isotopes, most notably &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N, which is generated via &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + γ → &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N + n, where γ denotes a photon and n a neutron. However, this reaction has hitherto not been observed conclusively, despite increasing observational evidence of neutrons and positrons that are presumably derived from such reactions. Here we report ground-based observations of neutron and positron signals after lightning. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a γ-ray flash with a duration of less than one millisecond was detected at our monitoring sites 0.5-1.7 kilometres away from the lightning. The subsequent γ-ray afterglow subsided quickly, with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 milliseconds, and was followed by prolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolts, which lasted for a minute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 megaelectronvolts of the γ-ray afterglow are well explained by de-excitation γ-rays from nuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line emission corresponds to electron-positron annihilation, providing conclusive evidence of positrons being produced after the lightning.},

abstract = {Abstract An on-ground observation program for high-energy atmospheric phenomena in winter thunderstorms along the Japan Sea has been performed via measurements of gamma ray radiation, atmospheric electric field, and low-frequency radio band. On 11 February 2017, the radiation detectors recorded gamma ray emission lasting for 75 s, and then abruptly terminated with a nearby lightning discharge. The gamma ray spectrum extended up to 20 MeV and was reproduced by a cutoff power law model with a photon index of , being consistent with Bremsstrahlung radiation from a thundercloud (known as a gamma-ray glow or a thunderstorm ground enhancement). The low-frequency radio monitors, installed ∼50 km away from the gamma ray observation site recorded leader development of an intracloud/intercloud discharge spreading over ∼60 km area with a ∼300-ms duration. The timing of the gamma ray termination coincided with the moment when the leader development of the intracloud/intercloud discharge passed 0.7 km horizontally away from the radiation monitors. The intracloud/intercloud discharge started ∼15 km away from the gamma ray observation site. Therefore, the glow was terminated by the leader development, while it did not trigger the lightning discharge in the present case.},

abstract = {Abstract The analysis of high-energy background radiation (0.1–2 MeV) enhancements during eight winter thunderstorms and five summer storms in the Ebro delta region in the northeast of Spain is presented. For the first time, high-energy radiation counts, precipitation, radar reflectivity, and very high frequency lightning detections to infer charge regions altitude have been analyzed in order to find out what produces the measured background radiation increments associated with storms. The good agreement between radar reflectivity and precipitation with increases in background radiation counts coupled with the spectrum analysis comparing rain/no rain periods suggests that radon-ion daughters play a major role in the radiation increments reported. No evidence has been found supporting that measured background radiation enhancements can be produced by storm electric fields. Finally, a single case of a high-energy radiation increase was prior to a cloud-to-ground lightning stroke, which reinforces the theory that a lower positive charge layer's existence is important for the production of Terrestrial Ground Enhancements.},

abstract = {Abstract This work presents the first simultaneous X-ray measurements from natural lightning in coincidence with a very high frequency (VHF) broadband interferometer. During an observational campaign in north-central Colombia, five intense X-ray bursts were detected from negative stepped leaders and two X-ray emissions from a dart leader. Thanks to the high angular and time resolution of the interferometer, it was possible to locate the origin of high-energy radiation during the lightning leader propagation. We study the correlation with VHF pulses and the two-dimensional speed of the leader channels. A strong temporal correspondence has been observed between the high-energy emissions and the most intense VHF pulses, which suggests the runaway electrons as a shared mechanism. The observations show that an X-ray burst can have multiple high-energy sources belonging to different leader branches, that can be several hundreds of meters apart. Therefore, from a spatial point of view, not a unique origin has to be searched, but an extensive origin of the X-ray burst should be considered. We hypothesize similar conclusions in particular for downward TGFs and maybe for TGFs in general.},

abstract = {Lightning is located by using the time of group arrival (TOGA) of the VLF (3–30kHz) radiation from a lightning stroke. The dispersed waveform (“sferic”) of the lightning impulse is processed at each receiving site. The TOGA is determined relative to GPS at each site from the progression of phase versus frequency using the whole wave train. Unlike current VLF methods which require transmission of the whole wave train from each site to a central processing site, the TOGA method requires transmission of a single number (the TOGA) for lightning location calculation. The stable propagation and low attenuation of VLF waves in the Earth–ionosphere waveguide (EIWG) allows a wide spacing of receiver sites of several thousand kilometer so that a truly global location service could be provided using only ∼10 receiver sites.}

In this paper, we describe the method of event coincidence analysis to provide a framework for quantifying the strength, directionality and time lag of statistical interrelationships between event series. Event coincidence analysis allows to formulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed interrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more generally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time distribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to country-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted as triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected future changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical techniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for investigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies and ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we report the first close, high-resolution observations of downward-directed terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) detected by the large-area Telescope Array cosmic ray observatory, obtained in conjunction with broadband VHF interferometer and fast electric field change measurements of the parent discharge. The results show that the TGFs occur during strong initial breakdown pulses (IBPs) in the first few milliseconds of negative cloud-to-ground and low-altitude intracloud flashes and that the IBPs are produced by a newly identified streamer-based discharge process called fast negative breakdown. The observations indicate the relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREAs) responsible for producing the TGFs are initiated by embedded spark-like transient conducting events (TCEs) within the fast streamer system and potentially also by individual fast streamers themselves. The TCEs are inferred to be the cause of impulsive sub-pulses that are characteristic features of classic IBP sferics. Additional development of the avalanches would be facilitated by the enhanced electric field ahead of the advancing front of the fast negative breakdown. In addition to showing the nature of IBPs and their enigmatic sub-pulses, the observations also provide a possible explanation for the unsolved question of how the streamer to leader transition occurs during the initial negative breakdown, namely, as a result of strong currents flowing in the final stage of successive IBPs, extending backward through both the IBP itself and the negative streamer breakdown preceding the IBP.},

abstract = {Abstract We present the ground-based observation of a terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF) that occurred between positive (second) and negative (third) strokes of a five-stroke bipolar cloud-to-ground lightning flash. Those two strokes shared the same channel to ground at a distance of 200 m or so from the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville (LOG), Florida. Earlier TGF observations at ground level in Florida (a total of four) were either associated with the initial continuous current (ICC) of rocket-triggered lightning flashes or occurred during the relatively steady current following the return-stroke current peak in natural lightning flashes; that is, in the presence of current-carrying channel to ground. The TGF presented here occurred in a different context: at the early (in-cloud) stage of negative leader entering the remnants of the channel previously created by the positive stroke. The TGF had a duration of 35 μs and consisted of 18 pulses with amplitudes ranging from 114 to 912 keV. The overall flash context in which the TGF occurred was as follows. The first (143-kA) stroke was negative and terminated on ground 1.4 km from LOG, the second (12-kA) stroke was positive and forged a new path to ground about 200 m from LOG, and the third (28-kA) stroke (TGF producer) was negative and followed the path of the second (positive) stroke. The fourth (43-kA) stroke was negative and created a new termination on ground about 900 m from LOG, and the fifth (4.5-kA) stroke was also negative and followed the fourth-stroke channel.},

abstract = {Ground-based observations of energetic radiation (X-rays/gamma-rays) associated with natural lightning discharges are presented and discussed. The emphasis is placed on relating X-ray/gamma-ray emissions to specific lightning processes. X-rays/gamma-rays have been observed in the following three contexts: (1) final stages of the descending leader, (2) collision of opposite-polarity streamers at the onset of lightning attachments process, and (3) in-cloud processes giving rise to energetic radiation bursts characteristic of Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs). In all three cases, the X-ray/gamma-ray production involves runaway electrons and can be materially influenced (enhanced) by the presence of previously created but decayed lightning channels. Such channels are characterized by elevated temperature (about 3,000 K vs. 300 K for ambient air), which significantly lowers the friction curve (representing the spatial rate of electron energy loss), so that its peak is an order of magnitude lower than that for cold air. As a result, in the electric field of about 4 MV/m (such and even higher fields are briefly produced near the tips of lightning leaders), ambient electrons can be accelerated over the friction-curve peak to the keV range and further to relativistic energies needed for production of X-ray/gamma-ray emissions. Significant avalanching of runaway electrons seems to be possible. For one very intense (55 kA) subsequent stroke, which was a prolific X-ray/gamma-ray producer, we estimated the spatial extent of strong (>4 MV/m) electric field region associated with the descending leader tip to be about 1.5 m, which is sufficient for multiplication of runaway electrons by a factor of 2 × 104 or so.}

abstract = {Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are bright, sub-millisecond bursts of gamma-rays, originating within the Earth's atmosphere. Most TGFs have been detected by spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. Only two TGFs have previously been observed from within our atmosphere: one at ground level and one from an aircraft at 14.1 km. We report on a new TGF-like gamma-ray flash observed at ground level, detected by the 19-station Thunderstorm Energetic Radiation Array (TERA) at the University of Florida/Florida Tech International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT). The gamma-ray flash, which had a duration of 52.7 μs, occurred on June 30, 2009 during a natural negative cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke, 191 μs after the start of the stroke. This event is the first definitive association of a gamma-ray flash with natural CG lightning and is among the most direct links to a specific lightning process so far. For this event, 19 gamma-rays were recorded, with the highest energy exceeding 20 MeV. The high-energy radiation exhibited very different behavior from the typical x-ray emission from lightning. Specifically, the gamma-ray flash had a much harder energy spectrum, consistent with relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) multiplication; it did not arrive in sub-microsecond bursts, typical of leader emission from lightning, and it occurred well after the start of the return stroke, which has not been previously observed for the x-ray emission from lightning. Nevertheless, we present evidence that the source region for the gamma ray flash was the same as that for the preceding leader x-ray bursts.},

The streamers are initiated in overbreakdown field conditions, 1.5Ekand2Ek, respectively, which may be found during the corona flash stage of negative leader stepping processes. We find that while streamer propagation produces stronger VHF radiation, the head-on collision of streamers dominates UHF, and even higher-frequency radiation. Analysis of the energy spectral densities obtained from different simulation cases shows that the total length and radii of colliding streamers, as well as the ambient field, are important parameters for the UHF radiation produced by streamer collisions. The larger those parameters are, the stronger UHF radiation produced. Finally, by comparing with the measured spectral magnitude of lightning field in the VHF range, it is found that there are probably 105–107 streamers involved during the lightning corona flash stage.},

Unlike detectors based on a Si diode, which are commonly used for long-term measurements, these detectors can also be used for detection of high-energy gamma-rays generated in thunderstorms. For a correct interpretation of the measured data it is important to perform an energy calibration and to verify the detector response in known radiation fields. The results obtained with several radionuclide sources were analysed using mathematical statistics methods. The detectors were also exposed onboard aircraft under well-defined conditions.}",

abstract = {The existing interpretation in the lightning literature, based on field measurements, defines recoil leaders as negative leaders. However recoil leaders are floating conductors, and, based on this physical assumption, they should be defined as bipolar and bidirectional leaders. This physics-based assumption has never previously been verified experimentally. Such verification, reported in this paper, has been obtained from observations of branched upward positive leaders from a tall tower using a high-speed video system synchronized with electric and magnetic field change and luminosity measurements on the ground. The analysis of these observations clearly reveals the nature of recoil and dart leaders as bidirectional and bipolar electrodeless discharges that develop from a small region along a path of the decayed channels of a previous positive leader, or a positively charged return stroke of negative CG flashes.}
