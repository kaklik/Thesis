\sec Lightning duration

The duration of the lightning event was determined by identifying local maxima of illumination on the camera chip over time from peaks that had a prominence higher than twice the noise level. The first and last maxima were used to identify the first and last frame, and the lightning duration was calculated from the framerate. The first ten frames of the camera recording were omitted to avoid potential artifacts from video data compression. The noise amplitude was established from the first 100 frames (from frame 10 to frame 110). Examples of duration determination for some lightning events are shown in Figure \ref[Camera_lightning_duration]. The histogram of lightning event durations, shown in Figure \ref[duration_histogram], includes 107 lightning events measured during 12 thunderstorms.

\medskip

To calculate the total length of a lightning event from a radio signal (see Fig. \ref[UHF_lightning_duration]), a similar methodology was used, where a signal greater than $4\sigma$, calculated from a moving window of 10~ms, marks the beginning of the lightning discharge. This algorithm is applied symmetrically from both ends of the recorded signal. For detecting the lightning start, the process begins from the first sample of the signal, and for detecting the lightning end, the process begins from the last sample of the recorded signal.

\medskip

The measured durations are usually in the order of hundreds of milliseconds, only exceptionally there are shorter lightning events. The median duration of lightning events is 524 ms. This result is significantly higher than was mentioned in previous studies 200-300~ms \cite[rakov_uman_2003] and 350~ms  \cite[López_Pineda_Montanyà_Velde_Fabró_Romero_2017].

The processing of lightning recordings differs for day and night storm observations as they require different settings of high-speed cameras, in particular, the setting of exposition length and analog gain varies. This difference could affect the exact measurements of the total length of a discharge, resulting however only in a shortening of the estimated time duration. Because of sunlight scattered in the atmosphere during the daytime, the weak discharges might have been omitted. Therefore the extracted time durations of lightning events could be possibly underestimated.

From the subsequent analysis of the lightning duration, two thunderstorms were excluded where it was not possible to distinguish individual lightning events, meaning there was no delay of at least 500 ms between the individual detected discharges. Lightning is considered to be an event where the time between the individual discharges does not exceed 100 ms.

\sec[Lightning_characterization] Lightning development/characterization

Data from the cameras reveal similar phases of lightning development. Examples of video recordings with individual phases visible and not obscured by clouds are provided.
Video \ref[video_1627302745.846055.mp4] captures (from T=+0.27 s (1:11) to T=+0.40 s (1:22)) a positive side of the leader. When the current flowing through the leader begins to weaken, recoil leaders start to appear at its end (T=+0.38 s (1:21)). The term recoil leader was taken from literature \cite[MAZUR2013763]. Based on the described observations, however, it is not confirmed that all the visible recoil leaders reuse an exactly already established ionized channel.

\secc Correlation of measured lightning with lightning detection network

The detection of lightning using the STP antenna has been compared with its detection using the Blitzortung.org network. It's important to note that not every lightning strike detected by the STP antenna is also detected by the Blitzortung.org network. Figure \ref[figur_blitz2] shows that when the storm was closest to the car according to Blitzortung.org, the STP antenna detected lightning at different times or at distances of more than 120 km. Conversely, as shown in Figure \ref[figur_blitz1], when the storm was located tens of kilometers away from the observation site according to Blitzortung.org, there was perfect conformity with the data from the STP antenna. In both figures, an interval of ±1 second is marked around the vertical lines corresponding to the detection times.

Lightning at 18:24:48 was detected by a high-speed camera, see video \ref[video_1627302288.9546976.mp4]. According to the video, one of the lightning channels occurred almost directly above the measurement car, but the nearest lightning detected by Blitzortung.org was at least 70 km away. The positioning accuracy in the case of the Blitzortung.org network is in the order of kilometers. Blitzortung.org detected discharges at a distance of 70 to 80 km simultaneously. This allows the deduction that this lightning was more than 80 km long or that a synchronous discharge occurred 80 km away.

\secc VLF lightning mapping

The described findings have direct implications, for example, on the way lightning discharge events should be displayed and localized. Given the typical dimensions and time scales on which discharges occur, it follows that even receivers operating on the VLF principle can provide meaningful descriptions of lightning discharge structures. At the same time, for the same reason, it is misleading to display lightning discharges on maps as points, which are intuitively interpreted as CG lightning strikes hitting the ground at approximately the position of the map mark. In reality, most of those points correspond to CC lightning discharges, given the actual incidence of their occurrence over CG lightning.

A better representation that considers this fact is attempted in Fig. \ref[VLF_lightning_map], which shows a calculated approximate visualization of the lightning structure. The representation is based on VLF data obtained from only three measuring stations placed on cars, so it contains many simplifications. For example, the lightning structure is depicted in a 2D plane positioned at a fixed height above the ground. Additionally, it is important to note that lightning discharges do not radiate at branching points, but primarily at the locations of two-thirds recoil leaders. The drawn connections do not reflect this fact, as the depiction is currently an illustrative algorithm that, despite its limitations, is a closer description of the physical principle of lightning discharges than the widely used depiction of points in a map.

\caption/f   An illustrative visualization of the structure of lightning discharges based on VLF data obtained from three measuring stations mounted on vehicles. The representation depicts the lightning structure in a 2D plane at a fixed height above the ground, capturing the approximate spatial distribution and progression of the lightning channels. The depiction emphasizes the complexity of the lightning and provides a closer representation of the physical nature of lightning discharges.
\medskip

The algorithm used\urlnote{https://github.com/ODZ-UJF-AV-CR/CRREAT_cars/blob/master/VLF_lightning/VLF_location.ipynb} for processing and visualizing VLF recordings from three measurement vehicles operates as follows. First, the recordings are aligned based on absolute time marks. Next, the data fragments are normalized, and any offsets are removed. The prepared recordings are then divided into a predetermined number of segments. The segment length varies, chosen to ensure each segment contains a similar amount of energy. This energy level and segmentation are determined algorithmically based on the total energy of the weakest signal. This method ensures each segment has significant morphological features necessary for calculating signal shifts. Finally, TDoA values are calculated by cross-correlating pairs of signals from the three stations.

The localization algorithm utilizes segments with at least two TDoA values that match physical constraints (e.g., time shifts cannot exceed the physical distance between stations). The navigation solution is then obtained by numerically solving the TDoA localization problem within an area situated above the plane where the stations are placed, at the expected cloud base altitude.

The fragment signal processing method is selected due to the aforementioned results. Additionally, the use of cross-correlation over signal segments provides significant advantages when one of the signals (in this case, CAR1) is heavily interfered with by uncorrelated noise absent from other stations. That is a feature that cannot be applied on conventional lightning detection networks, where only individually recorded pulses are processed.

The visualization is achieved through a graph algorithm that progressively adds points to the graph in a way that satisfies the geometric conditions related to lightning propagation, like utilizing adjacent lightning channels. This approach effectively eliminates the need for clustering algorithms commonly used \cite[Sibolla2021] to determine the lightning strike area, as the connection between individual parts of lightning is not lost in the process. The described algorithm could be significantly improved by implementing an algorithmic estimation of the optimal number of segments based on pre-analysis of the lightning development in the signal fragment, which could be probably done by some form of identification of lightning phases in the signal. In other words, the creation of a lightning signal model which should be then matched to the real signals from different stations.

\sec Conclusions

Initially, the apparatus was designed to observe lightning events within a time duration of a few hundreds of milliseconds, based on prior information summarized in section \ref[Initial_assumptions]. However, it was discovered that the duration of lightning is likely at least twice as long (considering that the observation method likely underestimates the duration). Similarly, the spatial extent of lightning phenomena is also larger, with lightning extending over predominantly flat space object measuring tens of kilometers. These findings, consistent across all apparatus used (cameras, radio detectors), directly impact current storm and lightning research. To observation of lightning events the recording devices with memory depths greater than 0.5 seconds are required. That finding significantly influences the instrumentation currently used in storm observations around the globe. To understand the initiation of lightning discharges (possibly by cosmic radiation as suggested in the introduction, \ref[problem_definition]), it is necessary to observe much larger ranges. Practically, this means searching events lasting microseconds in time intervals of several seconds. The need to expand the thunderstorm observed area to at least tens of kilometers, corresponding to more than 28 times of the previously assumed size, is another crucial finding.

From this significant change of observation geometry, caused by increase in dimensions, it follows that the electric field and the resultant RREA are more likely to radiate horizontally rather than vertically. This may explain why ionizing radiation could not be detected from below storm clouds using measuring vehicles. In contrast, the same detectors (GEODOS01) placed at elevated stationary locations (Polednik) detected radiation event in the absence of nearby lightning as we published in \mycite[j5]. This observation is significant because it revealed a new, previously unobserved type of radiation event where ionizing radiation is emitted during storms. This new type differs from TGFs, which last tens of microseconds to a millisecond, and also from TGEs, which last tens of seconds to minutes, by exhibiting an ionizing radiation flux increase lasting tens of milliseconds \mycite[j5].

Additionally, stationary ground-based electric field measurements (using standard electric field mills) did not correlate well with lightning discharges and provided limited information about lightning development. This indicates that such measurements should be performed in situ using UAVs, as significant lightning events can occur without a detectable electric field on the ground. This can be achieved with the newly designed electric field mill (THUNDERMILL01) and a semiconductor-based ionizing radiation detector optimized for UAVs.

Moreover, optical and radio observations demonstrated that the initiation of lightning discharges extends far beyond the brief period around the return stroke, developing over several seconds. The return stroke, often considered a key phase of lightning, appeared to be just one of several possible phases and occasionally did not occur at all (or in less than 10\% of discharges as noted in section \ref[radio_signal_measurements]). Hence, to understand the initiation of lightning discharges, the focus should shift from this statistically insignificant type to identifying the causes of the remaining 90\% of events.

Extended experiments revealed that the initiation of lightning discharges likely occurs far from the visible discharge area. Despite success in capturing a video potentially showing the initiation phase (See appendix \ref[attached_files]), it could not be analyzed due to missing contextual data from other instruments. Therefore, a simple correlation between ionizing radiation detection and lightning discharge is insufficient to determine causality and the required experiment is significantly more complex and demands much larger instrumentation coverage.

Finally, it was found that the current implementation of radio detection networks for lightning is inadequate. These networks process lightning as clusters of impulses, losing significant information, and often misinterpret data as ground strikes. The described research suggests a better visual representation of lightning discharges, avoiding misleading graphics and considering the physical development of lightning. Although this representation is still simplified and requires further work, it is a significant improvement over existing implementations.

\sec Fulfillment of Objectives

\begitems \style n
* {\bf Implementation of Lightning Detection Apparatus}: Multiple devices for detecting lightning and ionizing radiation were developed during the research. These include a method for triggering other devices based on lightning detection described in sections \ref[oscilloscope_trigger] and \ref[manual_trigger]. Additionally, an SDR-based receiver (described in section \ref[radio_receivers]) was designed for recording VLF signals (section \ref[VLF_receiver]) and UHF signals ( in section \ref[UHF_signal_receiver]) from lightning, using the active QFH antenna described in section \ref[UHF_signal_receiver]. The scintillation detector with a silicon photomultiplier was also developed, the design is resistant to electromagnetic interference and can measure ionizing radiation in the vicinity of lightning \ref[ionizing_radiation_detectors]. Furthermore, a unique Electric Field Mill was designed for measuring the electric field, which can be mounted on both cars and UAVs as described in section \ref[Electric_field_mills].

* {\bf Enhance understanding of Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Lightning Discharges}: It was discovered that lightning discharges cannot be characterized solely by a mark on a map, therefore the new visualization method of lightning from VLF data was demonstrated in section \ref[Lightning_characterization]. The developed apparatus at the same time revealed that lightning lasts longer and covers a larger area than was expected by the literature referenced in section \ref[Initial_assumptions]. This key finding led to significant changes in the instrumentation used for measuring and detecting lightning discharges. Based on these insights, it was demonstrated that lightning initiation can occur deep in the past, necessitating the instrumentation described in this work. The results were published in \mycite[j1].

* {\bf Enhancement of Measurement Techniques with in-situ atmospheric monitoring}: During multiple summer storm seasons, data on more than 100 lightning events were collected using the described measuring apparatus and methodology, which includes multiple innovations to which I contributed, namely the instrument triggering method and new sensors. Based on the measured characteristics of lightning, methods for monitoring storms were gradually improved. It was found that using an oscilloscope to record parameters during a lightning discharge was generally insufficient, so it was replaced with the SDR developed in this work. A scintillation detector that can be directly connected to the SDR input was also developed, enabling synchronous detection of electromagnetic fields and ionizing radiation. Additionally, several atmospheric sensors were created to distinguish increases in ionizing radiation from sources related to washout and natural background  rather than formation within clouds \ref[meteo_instruments]. The ionizing radiation detector was adapted for use onboard of UAV as described in section \ref[autogyro_thunderstorm]. The in-situ atmospheric measurement was also enhanced by the TF-ATMON system \mycite[j2]. To understand lightning initiation and the formation of ionizing radiation, the entire lightning signal must be analyzed to determine the actual return stroke position as is explained in section \ref[Lightning_characterization]. Observing the electric field not only below the cloud but also in the surrounding space was shown to be necessary based on figure \ref[figur_efmdatadetail]. These new findings and proposed instrumentation are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the causes of lightning and ionizing radiation in clouds. The situation necessitated the expansion of measuring instruments to include a broader range of devices. These included stationary detectors on elevated sites and in-situ measurements (of electric fields and ionizing radiation) using UAVs. Initial tests with stratospheric balloons showed promise, leading to efforts to use the autogyro for controlled in-situ measurements, as balloons are impractical for stormy conditions.

\sec Future Work

Future research needs to be  focused on in-situ measurements. UAVs, especially unmanned autogyro despite their limited effect in the described work, appear to be ideal for this purpose. It is necessary to measure the electric field in space (ideally as a 3D vector), which an autogyro, with its rotating rotor, could facilitate. That type of in-situ measurement should also include ionizing radiation detection.

The deployment of these approaches in subsequent studies is expected to yield substantial results, possibly confirming the direct detection of RREA and the directional structure of thunderstorm ionizing  radiation sources. That knowledge is essential to interpret the measured ionizing radiation and lightning event data to explain lightning initiation or eventually predict lightning occurrence.

The application of the TF-G2 autogyro in the described study has highlighted the potential and challenges of leveraging UAV technology for atmospheric research. The issues primarily stemmed from the software's maturity, which significantly impeded the ability to conduct successful measurements during storm activity. This aspect of technology, while a limitation in the current study, offers a critical area for improvement and optimization in future work. Enhancing the stability and reliability of UAV-related code will undoubtedly augment higher capability to collect high-fidelity atmospheric data from nearby or within storms, thereby enriching the understanding of thunderstorm dynamics, improving weather prediction models, and contributing to climate studies. Therefore continuous development and field testing of the unmanned autogyro and related technologies are required.
